My Experience
=============

I started using WhatsApp Web during my remote work routine. At first, I used to pick up my phone every few minutes to reply to messages — which often broke my concentration.

Once I set up WhatsApp Web, everything changed. I could type faster, manage files easily, and stay connected without disrupting my workflow. Uploading documents, responding to urgent messages, and organizing group chats became much more efficient.

It felt like having my phone inside my computer — but without the usual distractions of apps and calls.

Tips to Use WhatsApp Web Safely
===============================

- 🔒 Always **log out** after using WhatsApp Web on shared or public computers.  
- 🔐 Enable **two-step verification** for extra account security.  
- ❌ Avoid scanning QR codes from unofficial websites — always go to `web.whatsapp.com <https://web.whatsapp.com>`_.  
- 📲 You can log out remotely from your phone at any time under **Linked Devices**.
